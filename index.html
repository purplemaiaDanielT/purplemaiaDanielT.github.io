        <h2 class="section_content">About us...</h2>
        <p>Our cafe started as an idea between two friends. Both likes cats; both likes to drink coffee; and so, both would like to drink coffee with cats. You are welcome to relax and enjoy all that we offer. And, if you meet that special cat you would like to adopt, we can help with that, as well.</p>
